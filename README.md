## Overview

AH99 stands for AgencyHill99 Game.
AH99 is designed to reward users for their orders.<br>
The pre-sale platform currently allows users to buy AH99 tokens before our public launch.<br>
The staking functionality will allow holders to stake their tokens and earn rewards, while the trading interface is aimed at providing liquidity and facilitating transactions among users.<br>
It has features such as a user-friendly interface for purchasing tokens, wallet integration, and basic transaction tracking.<br>
Need to expand this by adding staking options to incentivize holding AH99 tokens and a trading interface to provide liquidity.
